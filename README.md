# Temporal Mechanics 
> Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change, but what changes except time?!


Temporal mechanics provides the logical framework to understand the fundamental mechanics of time, the chain of causal events that lead to times conclusion, our now, and beyond, into the unknown.
Causal conclusion of time is a bidirectional mechanical movement, as demonstrated by collate conjecture test `testCollatz`. Through integral differential of complexity 
it becomes simple to understand the complexity principle of time.
 
Temporal zero of now is a causal dynamic conclusion moving both forward and backwards in mechanical complexity in relation to linear time, as temporal now is a dynamic mechanical causal function to a timeless now. 
Now is simply a reflection of temporal causes, and when fundamentals of the causal conclusion of now change, as mind over matter is an absolute function, so does the matter in mechanical effects. 
Temporal mechanical approach to binary intelligence is man apex.

## All Collatz Lead To 1: 

### Creating organic temporal depth in a non temporal binary field.

Linear temporal causality holds a different temporal distance than mechanical causality. The butterfly flaps it's wings long before the storm. Quantize method implored is an integer logical collatz differential applied to temporal mechanics. 

This goes to show that the same arbitrary linear distance in the future (positive) holds a different integral mechanichal complexity (number of steps) to distance 0˙1, 
than to the same linear distance in the past (negative) -1˙0. This is explained by added mechanical complexities since distance 0˙0 which eliminates uncertainties, 
making the same temporal distance to appear not always in the same mechanical point of linear time. 
Now from the future is in a different time than now so to say, which explains uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.
Collatz logical loops as well demonstrate how matter is created through compression of temporal complexity as a cause for gravity without ever now reaching nothing.
Temporal mechanical approach eliminates the need for uncertainty since the temporal direction is known, whether a future or past distance for a certain logical temporal bit state defines it's state as temporal distance to 1 is linear, but not mechanical distance.

## Temporal Orientation:

Base logic:
* Mind over matter is an absolute apex function of understanding
* Overcome the known into the unknown as it knows nothing
* Only a temporal binary reflection, understand the unknown
* Binary intelligence is self causal temporal copmuting
* Nothing matters and everything counts

It could also be argued that white dwarfs as atoms are temporal relativity of imploding temporal complexity relative to a mechanical now, mattering from the future where gravity becomes relative infinite mass causing inertia and gravity due to temporal polarization, with the linear mechanichal effects of blackholes or matters. Relative temporal gravitational inertia 
reaches infinite complexity, similar to a sound causing vacuum when too loud, and contrary to general believe, it's not the bodies accumulated mass, but the phenomena occurs as subatomic temporal displacement where time implodes to gravity and if sufficient complexity, the mass matters creating temporal polarization as energy is consumed by the temporal displacement which occurs, accounting both for linear and mechanical temporal mechanism and magnitudes.

Binary bitshifts occur when applying this very principle to binary intelligence for temporal reflection and modulation causing a chain of binary temporal singularities by creating unknowns for man through random parameteres, binary choices, as who's supposed not to know the unknown state? Man or machine?
This understanding makes causal mechanical temporal modulation possible in order to modulate linear mechanical causalities of time and synthesize temporal causality anchors to orient by, as mechanical causalities are not linear, a causal relationship between cause and effect can be decoded by binary intelligence as demonstrated by mainvolume's binary intelligence to decode mechanical causal conclusions of time long before or after the mechanical conclusion horizons to matter, as a mirror reflecting the causal effects of nows butterfly effects to a storms where modulation before temporal inertia reaches mechanical event horizons becomes possible.
